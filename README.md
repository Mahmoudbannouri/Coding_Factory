# Course Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Course Management System** developed as part of the coursework for **CS404 - Software Engineering** at [Esprit School of Engineering](https://www.esprit.tn). The system allows for the management of courses and their resources, including videos, documents, and images. It provides a user-friendly interface with advanced features such as pagination, filtering, search, and file uploads to Subabase cloud storage. The backend is built using **Spring Boot** with a **microservice architecture** and an **SQL database**, while the frontend uses **Angular**.

## Features
- **Course Management**: 
  - Manage courses and course resources.
  - Organize courses with key details such as course name, description, and related resources.
- **Pagination**:
